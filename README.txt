** Note from Kevin on libdlusb compatibility **
Due to the fact libdlusb is incapable of transmitting all the information
generally used with the contact application (currently it is capable of 
only transmitting name, type, and phone number) I have intentionally organized
the format to be convenient for saving into the note application instead. This 
allows the user to have multiple phone numbers per entry along with an e-mail
address.
